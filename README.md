# FuserMIDISupport
MIDI Support for Fuser gameplay, designed for useability and customizability.

# MIDI Control is now possible in Fuser!

## MIDI Support Open Beta 1
I have made a custom, *open source* tool for Fuser that allows LaunchPad and other MIDI device users to map essentials controls to their devices! 

Features: 
- Static and Animated Lighting controls for devices with lighting
- Easy text-based control mapping
- Mouse controls for accessibility
- Framework for custom controls and bindings
